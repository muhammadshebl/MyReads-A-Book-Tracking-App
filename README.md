# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

## About

 Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project in which I have created a bookshelf app that allows user to select
 and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build 
 the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you 
 interact with the application.
